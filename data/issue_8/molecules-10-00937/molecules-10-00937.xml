    <p>This review presents a survey of the condensations of 3-formylchromone with various active methylene and methyl compounds, e.g. malonic or barbituric acid derivatives, five-membered heterocycles, etc. The utilisation of the condensation products for the synthesis of different heterocyclic systems, which is based on the ability of the <italic>&#x3B3;</italic>-pyrone ring to be opened by the nucleophilic attack is also reviewed. Finally, the applications of microwave irradiation as an unconventional method of reaction activation in the synthesis of condensation products is described and the biological activity of some chromone derivatives is noted.</p>

   <title>Introduction</title>
   <p>From a synthetic viewpoint, 3-formylchromone (<bold>1</bold>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-10-00937-f001">Figure 1</xref>) occupies an important position in the synthesis of various heterocyclic systems. Due to the availability of three electron deficient sites: carbon C-2, the aldehyde carbon and the C-4 carbon of the carbonyl group, 3-formylchromone is able to serve as a heterodiene as well as a dienophile or a Michael acceptor and fused heterocycles can be prepared directly by reaction of <bold>1</bold> with bifunctional nucleophiles.</p>

   <p>Since a facile synthesis of <bold>1</bold> by the Vilsmeier&#x2013;Haack reaction was first published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1-molecules-10-00937">1</xref>], the interest on the chemistry of chromones and their pharmacological utilisation hasn&#x2019;t decreased. Several reviews dealing with the synthesis, properties and reactions of <bold>1</bold> were published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-molecules-10-00937">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3-molecules-10-00937">3</xref>], however, condensations of <bold>1</bold> with active methylene and methyl compounds didn&#x2019;t appear to generate great interest in the earlier research.</p>
   <p>This review presents the synthetic capability and the exploitation of the abovementioned types of condensation, achieved using the microwave irradiation method of synthesis as a new and very convenient rate enhancing method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4-molecules-10-00937">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5-molecules-10-00937">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6-molecules-10-00937">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7-molecules-10-00937">7</xref>]. Several types of subsequent reactions of the condensation products illustrate the ability of chromone derivatives to serve as excellent precursors for the synthesis of a wide variety of heterocyclic systems.</p>

    <title>Condensations of <italic><bold>1</bold></italic> with malonic acid derivatives</title>
    <p>3-Formylchromones readily react with malonic acid and its derivatives in the presence of base, mostly pyridine (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-10-00937-f002">Scheme 1</xref>). Reaction of <bold>1</bold> with malonic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8-molecules-10-00937">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-molecules-10-00937">9</xref>] or diethyl malonate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9-molecules-10-00937">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10-molecules-10-00937">10</xref>] in the presence of pyridine afforded <italic>E-&#x3B2;</italic>-(4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran-3-yl)acrylic acids <bold>2a</bold> (R<sup>1</sup> = H) or ethyl acrylates <bold>2b</bold> (R<sup>1</sup> = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>), which strongly inhibit the secretion of histamine, therefore they can serve as the suitable agents for the treatment of allergic diseases, especially bronchial asthma. Reaction of <bold>1</bold> with cyanoacetic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11-molecules-10-00937">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12-molecules-10-00937">12</xref>] led to <italic>E</italic>-<italic>&#x3B2;</italic>-(4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran-3-yl)acrylonitriles <bold>3a</bold> (R<sup>1</sup> = H) in 56&#x2013;74 % yields. Finally, condensation of <bold>1</bold> with malondinitrile, reported by Ellis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13-molecules-10-00937">13</xref>] gave derivative <bold>3b</bold> (R = H, R<sup>1</sup> = CN) in 72% yield after 10 min heating at 42 &#xB0;C.</p>
    <p>When 6-substituted <bold>1</bold> were refluxed for 8 &#x2013; 12 hrs with malonic diamide in pyridine, 3-substituted 5-(2-hydroxybenzoyl)-2(1<italic>H</italic>)-pyridones <bold>5</bold> were obtained in 62-71% yields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14-molecules-10-00937">14</xref>]. Cyanoacetamide reacted with <bold>1a</bold> (R = H) or <bold>1b</bold> (R = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) under the similar conditions to produce the mixture of <bold>5a</bold> (<bold>5b</bold>) together with <bold>6a</bold> (<bold>6b</bold>). In the case of 6-nitro-3-formylchromone only <bold>5c</bold> (R = NO<sub>2</sub>) was isolated in 57%  yield.  Reaction  of  <bold>1b</bold>  with  cyanoacetamide  provides  2-cyano-3-(6-ethyl-(4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran-3-yl)acrylamide <bold>4</bold> in 42 % yield after 5 min reflux. Whereas <bold>4</bold> was transformed to <bold>5b</bold> (R = C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>) in 60% yield by prolonged reflux in pyridine, in the presence of water, both <bold>5b</bold> and <bold>6b</bold> (1:1) were isolated (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-10-00937-f002">Scheme 1</xref>).</p>

    <title>Condensations of <bold>1</bold> with 2,4-pentanedione</title>
    <p>Condensation of <bold>1</bold> with an excess amount of 2,4-pentanedione (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-10-00937-f003">Scheme 2</xref>, path a) in boiling ethanol catalysed by ammonium acetate furnished 3-acetyl-5-(5-R-2-hydroxybenzoyl)-2-methyl-pyridines <bold>9</bold> in 20&#x2013;29% yields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15-molecules-10-00937">15</xref>]. The mechanism of this reaction involves the initial base-catalysed condensation of <bold>1</bold> with 2,4-pentanedione to obtain 3-[(4-oxo-4H-1-benzopyran-3-yl)methylene]-pentanediones <bold>7</bold>, followed by the cleavage of the pyrone ring at C-2 by ammonia and cyclisation of <bold>7</bold> to afford <bold>9</bold> <italic>via</italic> non-isolable intermediate <bold>8</bold>. Product <bold>7</bold> was also synthesized in 60% yield by condensation of <bold>1</bold> and 2,4-pentanedione in acetic anhydride &#x2013; sodium acetate medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-molecules-10-00937">16</xref>]. Benzophenones <bold>14</bold> were obtained in low yields (15&#x2013;30 %) along with <bold>7</bold> (30&#x2013;40 %) by the addition of a solution of <bold>1</bold> in acetic acid to a preheated (70&#x2013;80 &#xBA;C) mixture of 2,4-pentanedione in acetic acid containing a catalytic amount of hydrochloric acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-molecules-10-00937">17</xref>]. The formation of <bold>14</bold> (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-10-00937-f003">Scheme 2</xref>, path c) can be explained by a mechanism which involves the acid-catalysed 1,4-addition of the enol form of 2,4-pentanedione to <bold>1</bold>, followed by ring opening to generate intermediate <bold>10</bold>, which then enolises to <bold>12</bold>. Benzophenone <bold>14</bold> is finally obtained by cyclisation of <bold>12</bold> to <bold>13</bold> and subsequent dehydration and tautomerisation.</p>

    <p>When the mixture of <bold>1</bold>, 2,4-pentanedione and the catalytic amount of hydrochloric acid is treated in acetic acid at room temperature and then heated at 70&#x2013;80&#xBA;C for 2 hrs, only products <bold>7a</bold> and <bold>7b</bold>, respectively, were isolated in 40&#x2013;45% yields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17-molecules-10-00937">17</xref>], which demosntrates 1,2 &#x2013; addition of 2,4-pentane-dione to protonated <bold>1</bold>. On the other hand, the mechanism of base-catalysed condensation of <bold>1</bold> consists on the initial attack of the nucleophile at the C-2 of pyrone ring, followed by ring opening and recyclisation to <bold>11</bold> with subsequent elimination of water to give <bold>7</bold> (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-10-00937-f003">Scheme 2</xref>, path b) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2-molecules-10-00937">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-molecules-10-00937">16</xref>].</p>

    <title>Condensations of <bold>1</bold> with ethyl acylacetates</title>
    <p>Condensation products <bold>15</bold>, prepared in 63 or 30 % yields from <bold>1</bold> and ethyl acetoacetate or ethyl benzoylacetate in sodium acetate &#x2013; acetic anhydride medium served as the intermediates for synthesis of diethyl 5-(2-hydroxybenzoyl)-2-methylisophtalate <bold>16</bold> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16-molecules-10-00937">16</xref>] (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-10-00937-f004">Scheme 3</xref>).Thus, <bold>15a</bold> (R = CH<sub>3</sub>) on treatment with excess ethyl acetoacetate in the presence of piperidine in ethanol gives <bold>16</bold>, which can be also formed in 80 % yield by one-step reaction of <bold>1</bold> with excess ethyl acetoacetate in piperidine &#x2013; ethanol medium (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-10-00937-f004">Scheme 3</xref>, path a). The proposed mechanism involves initial condensation of <bold>1</bold> with ethyl acetoacetate followed by Michael addition of the second molecule of ethyl acetoacetate and subsequent rearrangement (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-10-00937-f004">Scheme 3</xref>, path b).</p>

    <title>Condensations of <bold>1</bold> with 5-nitrofuryltrichloromethylsulphone</title>
    <p>Product <bold>17</bold> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18-molecules-10-00937">18</xref>] was formed, when <bold>1</bold> was treated with 5-nitrofuryltrichlormethylsulphone in glacial acetic acid in the presence of ammonium acetate and piperidine at 50&#x2013;80 &#xB0;C. Further <bold>17</bold> gave with diazomethane the cyclopropanes <bold>18</bold> instead of the expected pyrazoline derivatives.</p>

    <p>These results can be explained by non-finished stepwise mechanism (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-10-00937-f005">Scheme 4</xref>). Nucleophilic attack of diazomethane on the polarised C=C double bond of trisubstituted ethylenes produces carbanion, which undergoes a cyclopropane forming S<sub>N</sub>i reaction with the simultaneous elimination of N<sub>2</sub>.</p>

    <p>When <bold>1</bold> was treated with 5,5-dimethylcyclohexane-1,3-dione (dimedone) in aqueous ethanol, a 2:1 adduct <bold>21</bold> was formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19-molecules-10-00937">19</xref>] . Reaction in pyridine gave the same product <bold>21</bold>, which was dehydrated to xantone derivative <bold>22</bold> (73 %) by recrystalization in ethanol, containing hydrochloric acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20-molecules-10-00937">20</xref>] (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-10-00937-f006">Scheme 5</xref>).</p>

    <p>On the other hand, when condensation of <bold>1</bold> with dimedone took place in acetic anhydride in the presence of potassium acetate, expected adducts <bold>19</bold> were isolated in 54&#x2013;64 % yields by reflux for 1 hr as well as under 4&#x2013;6 min irradiation in microwave oven [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-molecules-10-00937">21</xref>]. Various heterocyclic aldehydes, including 3-formylchromone, were condensed with 2,2-dimethyl-1,3-dioxane-4,6-dione (Meldrum&#x2019;s acid). Product <bold>20</bold> was obtained in 63 % yield by heating of <bold>1</bold> with Meldrum&#x2019;s acid in chloroform in the acetic acid&#x2013;piperidine medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22-molecules-10-00937">22</xref>] (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-10-00937-f006">Scheme 5</xref>).</p>

    <title>Condensations of <bold>1</bold> with 1,3-indandione and the other five-membered fused heterocycles</title>
    <p>1,3-Indandione was used as a component for condensations with <bold>1</bold> under various reaction conditions. Products <bold>23</bold> were synthesized in 61&#x2013;92% yields either by 20 min of reflux in glacial acetic acid in the presence of piperidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23-molecules-10-00937">23</xref>] or by 4&#x2013;6 min of the microwave irradiation in acetic anhydride without any catalyst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-molecules-10-00937">21</xref>]. Nearly identical yields (61%) were obtained when these reactions were performed in ethanol in the absence of a catalyst at room temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24-molecules-10-00937">24</xref>].</p>
    <p>It is also possible to obtain the same product <bold>23</bold> in pyridine after 3 hrs at room temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20-molecules-10-00937">20</xref>].

    <p>Reactions of <bold>23</bold> or <bold>26</bold> with aqueous ammonia led to 3-(2-hydroxybenzoyl)-5-oxoindano[3,2-<italic>b</italic>]pyridine (<bold>25</bold>) in 81% yield and 3-(2-hydroxybenzoyl)[1]benzothieno[3, 2-<italic>b</italic>]pyridine-5,5-dioxide (<bold>28</bold>) in 89% yield. In comparison with these results, adduct <bold>27</bold> didn&#x2019;t react with ammonia, what is explained by lower electrophilicity of carbonyl group. On the other hand, reaction of <bold>23</bold> with hydrazine sulfate in pyridine gave pyrazole <bold>24</bold> in 45% yield [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-molecules-10-00937">21</xref>]. [1,3]Thiazolo[3,2-<italic>a</italic>]benzimidazol- 3(2<italic>H</italic>)-one was prepared by the cyclization of (2-benzimidazolylthio)acetic acid in acetic anhydride. The following condensation with <bold>1</bold> under microwave irradiation for 18&#x2013;30 min as well as by the classical heating at 130&#xB0;C for 1.5&#x2013;3 hrs lead to high yields (60&#x2013;97 %) of products <bold>29</bold> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21-molecules-10-00937">21</xref>].</p>

    <p>Heating of <bold>33a</bold> in ethanolic or methanolic solution of sodium carbonate lead to 37&#x2013;78% yields of pyrroles <bold>34</bold> (<xref ref-type="scheme" rid="molecules-10-00937-f008">Scheme 7</xref>).

    <p>Reaction of <bold>1</bold> with 4-chromanone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43-molecules-10-00937">43</xref>] in ethanol&#x2013;triethylamine medium gave after 3 hrs of reflux benzopyrano-2,3-dihydrobenzopyranones <bold>82</bold> in high yields (67&#x2013;80 %). In the next step compounds <bold>82</bold> were refluxed for 2 hrs with ammonia in aqueous methanolic medium or with ammonium acetate in acetic acid to give benzopyrano[4-3-<italic>b</italic>]pyridines <bold>83</bold> in 50 &#x2013; 63 % yields. The <italic>o</italic>-hydroxybenzoyl moiety of <bold>83</bold> can be converted either to the coumarine or to benzofuran systems.

   <title>Conclusions</title>
   <p>Knoevenagel condensations of 3-formylchromone with active methylene and methyl compounds, described in this review, represent not only a convenient synthetic route leading to many biologically active compounds, but combined with the cleavage of the pyrone ring by the attack of nucleophiles and subsequent rearrangement, they are widely utilised in the synthesis of new heterocyclic systems. The microvawe irradiation method of reaction activation was in many cases successfully used for increasing the yields, as well as to achieve a considerable shorterning of reaction times.</p>
